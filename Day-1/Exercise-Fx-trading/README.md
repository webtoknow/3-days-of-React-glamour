## General indications

🔥 The working folder for this day will be _Day-1\Exercise\Code_.

🔥 You can find the exercises solutions for this day at _Day-1\Exercise\Solution_.

🔥 This rocket 🚀 will be followed by the statement of the exercise.

🔥 To help you to code without too many tears, 🎁 means that we are providing some hints to you.

## Exercise 0 - Initial Setup

🚀 Let's do the first step to build our first React application. We should start generating a new project with React and Typescript.

  🎁 One very easy method is to use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

  🎁 After generating the project, you should start it. *npm start* will do the job.

## Exercise 1 - Pages, Routing and Navigation

### Create pages

🚀 Our application will have many pages. Can you identify these ones based on the design? Let's create them as dummy React components.

  🎁 A very important thing when you write code is to be organized. So put these newly-created components into a new folder named *pages* under *fx-trading-app\src*.

  🎁 You can create the components as functions returning one simple message. Do not forget to export them to be available for import and use.

### Add routes using React Router

🚀 You should also can navigate through the pages you just created. So let's create now the navigation part.

  🎁 [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) should help you a lot with this exercise.

  🎁 After the instalation part, use the Router components to link your pages with appropriate URLs. This should be done in the root component: *App.tsx*.

## Exercise 2 - Update favicon

🚀 It is nice to have a logo for each application. Ours already has one. Let's put it as favicon to help users easily identify our app.

  🎁 We already packed the logo files for you [here](https://github.com//WebToLearn/3-days-of-React-glamour/raw/master/Design/fx-trading-favicon-package.zip)

  🎁 After downloading and unzipping, put them in _public_ folder.

  🎁 Link these images with our application via *head* section from *index.html* file:

  ```html
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
  <link
    rel="apple-touch-icon"
    sizes="180x180"
    href="%PUBLIC_URL%/apple-touch-icon.png"
  />
  <link
    rel="icon"
    type="image/png"
    sizes="32x32"
    href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon-32x32.png"
  />
  <link
    rel="icon"
    type="image/png"
    sizes="16x16"
    href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon-16x16.png"
  />
  <link
    rel="mask-icon"
    href="%PUBLIC_URL%/safari-pinned-tab.svg"
    color="#5bbad5"
  />
  <meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#da532c" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff" />
  <meta name="description" content="Fx Trading application" />
  <title>Fx trading app</title>
  ```

## Exercise 3 - Add global styles

🚀 Even if our application has many pages, they should seem to be from the same story. This means that a global style file should be filled in with some CSS. Does your styles makes the app look the same as in the design mockups?

  🎁 The global style file is *index.css*.

  🎁 The browsers can display the elements differently. To have the same standard, we need to import *normalize.css* file.

  🎁 You should define the style for some common tags and classes like _h1_..._h6_, _.btn-primary_ and so on:
  
  ```css
  @import-normalize;

    html, body{
    height: 100%;
    color: #373A3C;
  }

  h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
    color: #7C7C7C;
  }

  .btn-primary {
    background-color: #3496F0;
  }

  .btn-link {
    color: #3496F0;
  }
  .table-striped tbody tr:nth-of-type(odd) {
    background-color: #F2F2F2;
  }

  .flex {
    display: flex;
  }

  .flex-vertical-centered {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .title {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
    padding-bottom: 20px;
  }

  .title-border {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD;
  }

  .screen-full-height {
    height: 100vh;
  }
  ```

## Exercise 4 - Add Fontawesome

🚀 Our app looks prettier with icons. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) library will provide them to us.

  🎁 *index.html* is the place where you should import the library.

## Exercise 5 - Add Bootstrap

🚀 [Bootstrap](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/) helps us with styling. Let's install it.

  🎁 You should install *bootstrap* via *npm*.
  
  🎁 Then you should import its CSS file into _index.tsx_ file.

## Exercise 6 - Add Date package

🚀 We need to manipulate dates and it is already known that it's not an easy task. [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library comes for helping us.

   🎁 Install *date-fns* via *npm*.

## Exercise 7 - Add Axios

🚀 Our Front-End will request data from Back-End server. Let's install [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to do it.

  🎁 Install *axios* via *npm*.

## Exercise 8 - Add Alerts package

🚀 It is important to give feedback to the user and tell him if their requests were successfully or not. [CogoToast](https://cogoport.github.io/cogo-toast/) alerts are a nice way to display that info.

  🎁 Install *cogo-toast* via *npm*.

## Exercise 9 - Create blotter-view, fx-rates-view and widget components

🚀 When you have to build one big page, an important step is to divide it into many sections and make a component for each one, then put them together. Can you identify ours from *Dashboard* page? Let's create the components for each section and put them into the *Dashboard* one! Also, the navbar should be put there!

 🎁 To stay organized, put these newly-created components into a new folder named *components* under *fx-trading-app\src*.

 🎁 You can create the components as classes with *State* and *Props* interfaces, returning one simple message. Do not forget to export them to be available for import and usage.

 🎁 The navbar should be placed in the *header* section and will contain the logo (already present in *public/img* folder) and the *Log out* button (with no functionality at this moment).

 🎁 Do not forget also to create the style file for *Dashboard* and link it from the component file. *dashboard-page.css* will be placed into *src/styles* folder.
