## General indications

🔥 The working folder for this day will be _Day-2\Exercise\Code_. The code from previous day is already here.

🔥 You can find the exercises solutions for this day at _Day-2\Exercise\Solution_.

🔥 This rocket 🚀 will be followed by the statement of the exercise.

🔥 To help you to code without too many tears, 🎁 means that we are providing some hints to you.

## Exercise 0 - Configuration

### Download all npm dependencies

🚀 You already have all the names and versions of dependencies in *package.json*. To complete this exercise, you only need to download them.

  🎁 Use *npm* to download all dependencies.

  🎁 Take care from where you run the command. The folder should contain *package.json*.

### Install and use JSON Server

🚀 As you do not have a Back-end server, JSON Server will behave like one. Let's install it! Your database consists of 2 JSON files, so you should make JSON Server read from both of them.

  🎁 To avoid installing JSON Server for each place you will use it, install it globally via *npm*.

  🎁 Open one different terminal window for each database file and run JSON Server there on a different port.

## Exercise 1 - Blotter View section

### Transaction model

🚀 Typescript helps you to not make mistakes regarding the types of the objects sent and received from the server. Build a *Transaction* interface containing all properties defining a transaction and their types. The design mockups should help finding them.

 🎁 You should be organized again and make a new folder called *models* into _src_. This folder will contain all models from our app.

 🎁 Create your *Transaction* model in this newly-created folder.

### Constants file

🚀 You will need to make Back-end calls to some URLs. Put all of them into a *constants* file.

  🎁 Create *constants.tsx* file into _src_ folder.

  🎁 You have to use different ports depending on which microservice you call. We propose 8200 for *Auth*, 8210 for *Trade* and 8220 for *Quote* services.

### Implement polling mechanism

🚀 Transactions should be as accurate as possible, so you should simulate a real-time behavior. This can be done by implementing polling mechanism into *Blotter View* component.

  🎁 You should create a function which gets all the transactions using *axios*: *getTransactions()* and put them on the component's state.

  🎁 Also, because you have two distinct properties *primaryCcy* and *secondaryCcy* and you need to manipulate in the UI the pair of that 2, you should add a new property *ccyPair* just for display reasons.

  🎁 *getTransactions* will be called for the first time when the component is mounted, then at every 1s.

  🎁 It is very important from performance perspective to stop the timer when the component is destroyed.

### Blotter View render

🚀 As now you already have the transactions loaded from the server, you can start displaying them. Put there the table as in the design mockups.
  
  🎁 You should update the *render* function from the component to put there what you want to be displayed.

  🎁 In order to format the displayed date, use *date-fns*.

  🎁 The CSS for this file, *botter-view.css* should also be created in *styles* folder and imported from the component.

## Exercise 2 - FX Rates View section

### Rate model

🚀 Rate is another model we should create. Let's do it!

  🎁 The new file will be created into *models* folder.

### Widget model

🚀 Create also the *Widget* model.

  🎁 The new file will be created into *models* folder.

  🎁 Until now we just created interfaces. These can also be classes and the fields can be declared into the constructor.

### FX Rates View component

🚀 It's time to take care of the left-side part of the screen. We will need to get the currencies pairs and display all widgets.

  🎁 Currencies pairs will be loaded from *Quote Service* via *axios* when the component is created, then will be put on state.

  🎁 We will need to implement a function which add a new widget when clicking on "+". This new one will have all fields empty.

  🎁 The widgets can also be removed - JavaScript *splice* method can help here.

  🎁 As the widgets are maintained in the parent component - *FX Rates*, everytime a widget field is edited, we will call a method to update the state from the parent.

  🎁 A new file called _fx-rates-view.css_ should be created in *styles* folder and linked from the component. Put your style for *FX Rates* here. The design will help you!

  🎁 Because you passed some properties to the *Widget* component, Typescript will throw some errors. Put them also in *Widget Props*.

### Widget component

🚀 Let's now implement the *Widget* class. Same component will be used for both states:
    - one state which allows adding a new currency pair to let the user follow SELL and BUY rates
    - the other which allows saving a transaction.

 🎁 The first state of the component contains 2 dropdowns where Primary and Secondary currencies can be selected from the ones obtained by calling the backend through *startPolling()* method.

 🎁 *startPolling()* calls the method which get the FX Rates every second through axios.

 🎁 The second one allows saving a transaction. For this, the user have to enter the amount he wants to trade, the tenor (SP - now, 1M - in a month or 3M - in three months) and then press on the button which describes the action he want to do: Sell or Buy.

 🎁 Saving a transaction on sell or buy actions can be also possible via *axios*.

 🎁 The user should be also able to remove a widget.

 🎁 Every edit on the widget will be put on parent's state as it maintain all the widget items.

 🎁 Create a new file named *widget.css* in *styles* folder and links it with the component.
